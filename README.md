## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This project was a great refresher on key elements of HTML and CSS

### Walkthrough 🫡

Throughout this short project, I was encouraged to do research and stumbled across a great video by Andreas Remdt [youtubetutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANOz2JJqcgc)-All credit goes to him

Andreas did a great job of explaining the project in a very detailed manner.
Thanks to this video, I learned that you can download fonts and export them in your terminal to woff files to avoid any issues with browser links to said fonts.
I also learned to install a package called <i>LiveServer</i> which allows you to see the changes you make to your project in real-time without having to keep refreshing your browser!!

### Conclusion
Overall, this was a great way to get motivated about coding again and I can't wait to keep getting better

Heri 🤘🏻😎
